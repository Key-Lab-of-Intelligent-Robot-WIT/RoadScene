# RoadScene_Annotation：a new Semantic annotation dataset of infrared and visible images

The RoadScene_Annotation dataset is annotated with 121 aligned Vis and IR image pairs selected from RoadScene(https://github.com/hanna-xu/RoadScene).These images are highly representative scenes in life. For each instance, 14 semantic categories are defined and annotated except for the "background" category, i.e. “sky”, “tree”, “car”, “bicyclist”, “road”, “pavement”, “grass”, “fence”, “pedestrian”, “roadsign”, “building”, “pole”, “wire”, “light”. Each instance has annotations whenever the corresponding category appears in the current image.
